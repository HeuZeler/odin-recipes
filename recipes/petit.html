    <h2 class="description">Description</h2>

    <p class="descriptiontext">
        I know you probably know this dessert by the name “Lava Cake,” but I grew up calling it by its French name – 
        Petit Gateau – so that’s how I’ll keep calling it! <br> Also, it sounds more romantic and, therefore, 
        more appropriate for your Valentine’s Day’s romantic dinner, doesn’t it?
    </p>

    <h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

    <p>

    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> 2 4oz bars bittersweet chocolate </li>
        <li> 4 eggs </li>
        <li> 4 Tbsp sugar </li>
        <li> 4 Tbsp flour </li>
        <li> 1.5 sticks butter (room temperature) </li>
        <li> 2 Tbsp cognac (optional) </li>
    </ul>

    <p>

    </p>

    <ol class="instructions-list">
        <li> Preheat your oven to 500 degrees. </li>
        <li> Find two pots where one will fit into the other. Fill the big one halfway with water and put the little pot (preferably a saucepan) into the bigger pot. Bring them to the stove and heat them until the water boils, while you make the rest of the recipe.</li>
        <li> While the water is heating, add the eggs to a bowl and beat them with a whisk. Add the sugar and the flour and beat everything together until well incorporated. Reserve.</li>
        <li> When the water starts boiling, add the chocolate - in pieces - to the small pot and keep stirring with a spoon until the chocolate melts. This is called melting the chocolate in bain marie.</li>
        <li> Once the chocolate is melted, take the small pot from the big pot and set it on the counter. Add the butter and whisk until the butter is melted. Then, add the egg/sugar/flour mixture and whisk until you have something resembling a liquidy dough. Add the cognac, if using.</li>
        <li> Fill pre-greased ramekins with dough, 2/3 full. </li>
        <li> Bring the ramekins to the pre heated oven, for 5 minutes or until the cakes set on the outside, just enough to hold their shapes. </li>
        <li> Take the ramekins out of the oven and let them cool for a few minutes. </li>
        <li> Being careful so you don’t burn yourself and handling them with care so you don’t break them, turn the cakes upside down on the individual plates where you’re serving them. </li>
        <li> Serve them hot with vanilla ice cream. You can also decorate with sprinkled confectioners sugar, fruits (like raspberries), mint, chocolate syrup, etc. </li>
